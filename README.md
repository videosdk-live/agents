## Overview

The AI Agent SDK is a Python framework built on top of the VideoSDK Python SDK that enables AI-powered agents to join VideoSDK rooms as participants. This SDK serves as a real-time bridge between AI models (like OpenAI and Gemini) and your users, facilitating seamless voice and media interactions.

## Features

### Real-time communication
-   Real-time voice and media: agents can listen, speak, and interact live in meetings
-   SIP and telephony integration: seamlessly connect agents to phone systems via SIP for call handling, routing, and PSTN access
-   Virtual avatars: add lifelike avatars to enhance interaction and presence using Simli

### Intelligence and interaction
-   Multi-model support: integrate with OpenAI, Gemini, AWS NovaSonic, Anthropic, Cerebras, and more
-   Cascading pipeline: integrates with different providers of STT, LLM, and TTS seamlessly
-   Conversational flow: VAD, turn detection, RAG, and memory for smooth, context-aware conversations
-   Function tools: extend agent capabilities with event scheduling, expense tracking, and more
-   Client-side function calling: trigger actions directly from the client side for low-latency interaction

### Integration and connectivity
-   MCP integration: connect agents to external data sources and tools using Model Context Protocol
-   A2A protocol: enable agent-to-agent interactions for complex workflows
-   SDK support: available for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT

### Media and observability
-   Recording and transcription: capture and analyze conversations
-   In-built observability: access real-time and historical traces, logs, and metrics for monitoring and debugging

### Deployment and scalability
-   Deploy and scale: run on FlyIO, Kubernetes, or Agent Cloud (deploy close to your users)
-   Global coverage: infrastructure optimized for international availability and low latency
-   Scale and deploy on your cloud: flexible deployment to meet enterprise compliance and privacy needs

### Security and compliance
-   Security and compliance covered: enterprise-grade security protocols
-   End-to-end encryption of streams: ensure secure communication across the board

## Introduction

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Components
- **üñ•Ô∏è Your Backend:** Hosts the Worker and Agent Job that powers the AI agents
- **‚òÅÔ∏è VideoSDK Cloud:** Manages the meeting rooms where agents and users interact in real time
- **üì± Client SDK:** Applications on user devices (web, mobile, or SIP) that connect to VideoSDK meetings

### üîÑ Process Flow
1. **üìù Register:** Your backend worker registers with the VideoSDK Cloud
2. **üì≤ Initiate to join Room:** The user initiates joining a VideoSDK Room via the Client SDK on their device
3. **üì° Notify worker for Agent to join Room:** The VideoSDK Cloud notifies your backend worker to have an Agent join the room.
4. **ü§ñ Agent joins the room:** The Agent connects to the VideoSDK Room and can interact with the user.

## üöÄ Before You Begin

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A VideoSDK authentication token (generate from [app.videosdk.live](https://app.videosdk.live))
   - A VideoSDK meeting ID (you can generate one using the [Create Room API](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/create-room) or through the VideoSDK dashboard)
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Third-Party API Keys:
   - API keys for the services you intend to use (e.g., OpenAI for LLM/STT/TTS, ElevenLabs for TTS, Google for Gemini etc.).

## Installation

- Create and activate a virtual environment with Python 3.12 or higher.
    <details>
    <summary><strong>üíª macOS / Linux</strong></summary>
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    </details> 
    <details> 
    <summary><strong>ü™ü Windows</strong></summary>
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    </details>
    
- Install the core VideoSDK AI Agent package 
  ```bash
  pip install videosdk-agents
  ```
- Install Optional Plugins. Plugins help integrate different providers for Realtime, STT, LLM, TTS, and more. Install what your use case needs:
  ```bash
  # Example: Install the Turn Detector plugin
  pip install videosdk-plugins-turn-detector
  ```
  üëâ Supported plugins (Realtime, LLM, STT, TTS, VAD) are listed in the [Supported Libraries](#supported-libraries-and-plugins) section below.


## üèÅ Getting Started: Your First Agent

Now that you've installed the necessary packages, you're ready to build!

- For detailed guides, tutorials, and API references, check out our official [VideoSDK AI Agents Documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/ai_agents/introduction).
- To see the framework in action, explore the code in the [Examples](examples/) directory. It is a great place to quickstart.
- For Avatar support, check out the [Simli Avatar](videosdk-plugins/videosdk-plugins-simli) and [Avatar Examples](examples/avatar/).
- For SIP integration, refer to the [SIP Plugin](videosdk-plugins/videosdk-plugins-agentsip) and [SIP Agent Example](examples/sip_agent_example.py).


## Architecture

This architecture shows how AI voice agents connect to VideoSDK meetings. The system links your backend with VideoSDK's platform, allowing AI assistants to interact with users in real-time.
