# Contributing to videosdk/agents

The VideoSDK Agents framework is an open-source project, and we welcome any contribution from anyone
willing to work in good faith with the community. No contribution is too small!

## Code of Conduct

The VideoSDK Agents project has a [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to which all contributors
must adhere.

## Contribute code

There are many ways you can contribute code to the project:

- **Write a plugin**: If you use a TTS/STT/LLM/Realtime provider that isn't in our plugins list,
  consider writing a plugin for it! Check existing plugin source code for implementation examples.

- **Fix bugs**: Help improve framework reliability by fixing bugs and enhancing stability. See the
  guidelines below for pull request best practices.

- **Add new features**: We welcome new feature contributions. Please open an issue first to discuss
  the proposed functionality and scope before starting development.

We're still in early development phase, so any help is truly appreciated.

## Assist others in the community

If you can't contribute code, you can still help us greatly by helping out community members who
may have questions about the framework and how to use it. Join the `#agents` channel on
[our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/f2WsNDN9S5).
